📞 Contact Management System
    The Contact Management System is a Java-based application designed to help
    users store, manage, and organize their contacts efficiently.
    This system provides essential CRUD operations (Create, Read,
    Update, Delete) while ensuring data validation and persistent storage in a text file.
✨ Key Features
    ✔️ Add Contact – Create a new contact with name, phone number, and email.
    ✔️ Update Contact – Modify an existing contact’s phone number and email while keeping the name unchanged.
    ✔️ Delete Contact – Remove a contact from the list using their name.
    ✔️ Search Contact – Find and display a contact by name.
    ✔️ List All Contacts – View all saved contacts in a structured format.
    ✔️ Persistent Storage – Contacts are stored in a file and automatically reloaded when the program starts.
    ✔️ Data Validation – Ensures that name, phone number, and email are properly formatted and non-empty.
