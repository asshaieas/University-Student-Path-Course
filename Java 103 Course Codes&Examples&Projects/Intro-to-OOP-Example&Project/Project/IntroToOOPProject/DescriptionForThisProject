Library Management System
    This is a simple Library Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming
    (OOP) concepts in Java. The project allows users to manage a library collection,
    including adding books, removing books, and searching for books by their ISBN.
    It demonstrates fundamental principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Features:
    Add Books: Add new books to the library with details like title, author, price, and ISBN.
    Remove Books: Remove books from the library using their ISBN.
    Search Books by ISBN: Find books in the library using their ISBN and display their details.
    Display All Books: Display all the books currently in the library.
Project Structure:
    Book Class:
        This class represents individual books in the library with attributes like title, author,
        price, and ISBN. It includes getter and setter methods for these attributes,
        along with a custom toString() method to display book details.
    Library Class:
        This class represents the library, managing a collection of books.
        It provides methods to add, remove, and search books.
        The library's collection of books is stored in an ArrayList.
    LibraryBookTest Class:
        This is the main class where the library is tested.
        It demonstrates how to create books, add them to the library,
        remove books using ISBN, and search for books.
