🚗 Vehicle Inheritance Example in Java
    This example demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java,
    focusing on inheritance, the super keyword, and the protected modifier.
    It includes a Vehicle superclass and two subclasses:
    Car and Truck. A TestVehicles class is used to test the implementation.
📌 Concepts Covered:
    ✅ Inheritance: Car and Truck extend Vehicle, inheriting its attributes and methods.
    ✅ super Keyword: Used to call the parent class constructor in subclasses.
    ✅ protected Modifier: Allows subclass access to brand, model, and speed attributes.
    ✅ Method Overriding: displayInfo() is overridden in subclasses to display additional details.
📂 Example Structure:
VehicleExample/
    │── Vehicle.java      # Base class with common properties
    │── Car.java          # Subclass extending Vehicle (adds numDoors)
    │── Truck.java        # Subclass extending Vehicle (adds cargoCapacity)
    │── TestVehicles.java # Main class to test Vehicle, Car, and Truck

🛠 Class Descriptions:
    1️⃣ Vehicle.java (Base Class)
        Defines common properties:
        Attributes: brand, model, speed (protected).
        Constructor: Initializes attributes.
        Method: displayInfo() prints vehicle details.
    2️⃣ Car.java (Subclass of Vehicle)
        Extends Vehicle and adds:
        Attribute: numDoors (number of doors).
        Constructor: Calls super() to initialize parent attributes.
        Method Override: displayInfo() includes numDoors.
    3️⃣ Truck.java (Subclass of Vehicle)
        Extends Vehicle and adds:
        Attribute: cargoCapacity (in tons).
        Constructor: Calls super() for initialization.
        Method Override: displayInfo() includes cargoCapacity.
    4️⃣ TestVehicles.java (Main Class)
        Creates instances of Vehicle, Car, and Truck and calls displayInfo() for each.
📌 Example Output:
    Vehicle Details:
    Brand: Toyota
    Model: Corolla
    Speed: 180 km/h
    --------------------
    Car Details:
    Brand: Honda
    Model: Civic
    Speed: 220 km/h
    Number of doors: 4
    --------------------
    Truck Details:
    Brand: Ford
    Model: F-150
    Speed: 160 km/h
    Cargo Capacity: 5.5 tons
