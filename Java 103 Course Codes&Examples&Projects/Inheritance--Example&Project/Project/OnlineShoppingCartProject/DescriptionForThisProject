🛒 Online Shopping Cart Project
    📌 Overview
    The Online Shopping Cart Project is a Java-based application designed
    to simulate an e-commerce shopping experience. It allows users to add,
    remove, and manage different types of products in a virtual shopping cart.
    This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such
    as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while implementing
    user interaction through a console-based interface.
🚀 Features
    Product Management
        Add and remove products dynamically.
        Display details of available products.
        Support for multiple product categories.
    Product Categories
        General Products – Basic product attributes like name, price, and stock quantity.
        Electronics – Includes an additional warranty period attribute.
        Clothing – Includes size, color, gender, brand, and type.
    User Interaction
        Console-based menu for intuitive product management.
        Input validation to prevent incorrect data entry.

🏗️ Tech Stack
    Programming Language: Java
    Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Data Structure: ArrayList (for managing the shopping cart)
    User Input Handling: Scanner class
📂 Project Structure
OnlineShoppingCartProject/
    │── Product.java        # Base class for products
    │── Electronics.java    # Subclass for electronics products
    │── Clothing.java       # Subclass for clothing products
    │── ShoppingCart.java   # Manages product addition, removal, and display
🔍 OOP Concepts Used
    Encapsulation: Private/protected fields with getter and setter methods.
    Inheritance: Electronics and Clothing classes extend the base Product class.
    Polymorphism: Overridden toString() method for customized product descriptions.
🛠️ Future Enhancements
    Implement GUI-based interaction for better user experience.
    Add a payment system with checkout functionality.
    Integrate a database for persistent storage.
