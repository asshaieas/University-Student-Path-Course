Bank Loan System Project üöÄ
A simple Java-based Loan Processing System that allows users to
select and calculate loan details for Car Loan, Home Loan, and Personal Loan.



Project Overview:
This Bank Loan System is an interactive Java console application where users can:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Select a loan type (Car, Home, or Personal)
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Input the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term (years)
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Get calculated monthly payment using the loan amortization formula



Key Features
    ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Design using Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
    ‚úÖ Loan validation to prevent negative values
    ‚úÖ Uses Amortization Formula for loan calculations
    ‚úÖ User-friendly CLI (Command Line Interface)

How It Works
    The user selects the type of loan (Car, Home, or Personal).
    The system takes user input for loan amount, interest rate, and term.
    The system validates the input and prevents negative values.
    The selected loan object is created using polymorphism.
    The system calculates and displays the monthly payment.

Technologies Used
